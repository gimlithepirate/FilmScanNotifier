# FilmScanNotifier
An AutoHotKey scrip which notifies the user when a scan is completed using the EpsonScan Software. Basically, this software looks for
the little progress window you see, and when that disappears, it uses pushbullet to send a notification to your phone.

To use this script, you need two things:
1) The AutoHotKey environment, available here: https://autohotkey.com/download/ (NOTE: I have not tested with various versions. Thus far I know it works with 2.0)
2) A Pushbullet account with the app downloaded to your iOS or Android phone. Available here: https://www.pushbullet.com/
